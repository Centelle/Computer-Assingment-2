# Computer-Assingment-2
My solutions to Computer-Assingment-2 with questions and sample input 

The Question.txt file has the question statement along with the samele input and output to that particular question.

I added a small challenge in Question5 
Seperate the integer and decimal part of double value. Check files Task5_wrong.java and Task5_fix.java for this question.

However this is not required and the direct answer to this question is in file Task5.java which I have used in my project.
