Write a program to accept 10 different decimal numbers (double data type) in a
Single Dimensional Array (say, A). Truncate the fractional part of each number
of the array A and store their integer part in another array (say, B).

Input:
159.112
130.345
216.34
713.901	
8.378
35.7
638.290
341.823	
16.296	
966.405

Output:
Integer part of all numbers after truncating decimal part truncated = 
159, 130, 216, 713, 8, 35, 638, 341, 16, 966,
